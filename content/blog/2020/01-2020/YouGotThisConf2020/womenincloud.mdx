# Women in Cloud at Google UK

## Introduction 
Earlier this month I was lucky enough to attend Google's Women in Cloud event at their office in London! 
The day included a workshop, a meet and greet, and talks by various Google employees including a panel discussion on 
diversity and inclusion. It was filled with inspiration and I got to meet so many amazing people
both Google employees and attendees.

## Workshops

We all had a choice to select one workshop out of four - I was torn because they all sounded great! Do I chose a workshop
on Kubernetes? Or the workshop on negotiating? In the end I chose to attend #IAmRemarkable because I have been told
many times my technical skills are great (well, good enough at least) and most of my development areas are around my soft 
skills. Additionally, I have been told __many__ times that I need to be more confident. This is something I have found very
challenging because I've always wondered _"Where do I get confidence from? How does that belief come to me?"_

#IAmRemarkable recognises that women (and underrepresented groups) are lacking in certain roles and in senior positions.
They also understand that different perceptions and approaches women tend to take versus men, and as a result can
negatively impact the perceptions people have of women and potentially their chances of promotion. 

> "Men and Women don't like women who self promote"

> "Men will apply to a job where they match 60% of the criteria whereas women will apply if they meet 100%"

Unfortunately, accomplishments alone is simply not enough to get recognition and to move forward (fast) in your career. 
We all need to learn to value our contributions and self-promote. It may feel weird at first, but it's like a muscle; with practice 
self-promoting will eventually feel natural.

The main part of the workshop was to write out reasons we are remarkable by using the starting sentence __I Am Remarkable because...__

I wrote a few things like:
* I am remarkable because I teach women to code every week 
* I am remarkable because I am very independent and I decided to live in another country with no family 
* I am remarkable because I survived depression and decided that life is worth living
* I am remarkable because I try to help everyone around me as much as I possibly can

We were asked to share a personal and business example with the rest of the group. I was very nervous and even though the words 
flowing out of my mouth wasn't entirely coherant, everyone was very understanding and appreciative. 

Throughout the workshop many women were bringing forward their personal experiences and it was saddening, but also
amazing the things these ladies were doing in the face of adversity. It further highlighted that this is still a
problem in so many industries, but equally we are all capable of taking matters into our hands to make positive change.
