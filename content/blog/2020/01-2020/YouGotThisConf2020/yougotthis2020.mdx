# YouGotThis Conference

I was lucky enough to be around to attend this conference and have a ticket provided through their sponsorship program. 
I thought the least I could do is write what I've learned from it and give it some attention that it deserves!

The aim of the conference is to give advice for new developers in regards to culture, performance reviews, personal development,
health, career change and so on. I've learned a lot from it - especially as I've spent so long thinking that it's critical I continue
enhancing my technical skills. I've unfortunately let my softer skills dwindle, which may be impacting my projects at work.
