# Intro

On the 18th of January was the YouGotThis conference at Millenium Point, Birmingham, UK.
The aim of the conference is to give advice for new developers in regards to culture, performance reviews, personal development,
health, career change and so on. I went as I knew it would be useful, but I was blown away at the quality of the talks and 
how much I learned. I'm normally focused on improving my technical skills, but I recently realised that I 
need to develop my soft skills too. Especially if I want to progress and go from junior to a lead / senior role one day!

As a thank you to [organiser] for providing me the chance to go via their sponsorship program I'm doing a write up of the day
and highly encourage people to attend next year!

_Note: I had something come up in the morning so I unfortunately missed the first two talks, 
but their talks should be uploaded so check out [their website!](http://2020.yougotthis.io/)_

# Topics

## Mentoring

First talk I watched was about finding and developing mentor/mentee relationships by Amina. 
She describes different online resources someone can utilize to connect with people and how they can use those platforms to do different
activities to level up your developer skills. 

### Creating the relationship

For example __LinkedIn__ is great for expanding your network, especially if you have little
prior experience in the industry whereas __GitHub__ offers the chance to work with others on existing code bases and receive feedback
on your code. There are so many online services and social networks that you can use to engage with others and that can lead up to 
creating a mentor/mentee relationship or at the very least some great advice to help your career!

She also identifies 5 key steps for developing a mentor relationship with someone:

1. Describe your story so you can create a human connection with others
2. Research and don't ask questions that are already answered
3. What is your call to action? Make it clear and easy to do (don't try to do everything all at once)
4. Implement tests - start with small requests
5. Ask for referrals - the person you contact will know others in the industry who can help you

### Maintain & Finishing the relationship 

Once you have a mentor then don't forget to nurture the relationship - it's a two way commitment! Ask them what they want out
of mentoring you and ensure when you engage with them you are action focused and request appropriate advice. 
Finally, after all your mentoring sessions it's okay to end the relationship. For example if you have finally been promoted to
be a senior developer. 

Thanks Amina for sharing your advice - I have always wondered _how_ to get a mentor online and I feel much more confident
on how I can achieve this. Now it's time to find someone who has the experience I'm looking for!

## So good they can't ignore you!

This next talk is by Gargi. She explains that although it appears that businesses are assessing employee performance in a 
meritocractic way, the truth is it isn't always like that. 

> Meritocracy is based on a utilitarian interpretation of our work

So it's all about the results of our actions. As long as we are achieving the tasks that need to be done,
then everything is good. It ignores the concept of justice because it maximises outputs regardless of actions to get there. 

What does that mean? We need to self-promote and recognise the things we do that deserves the recognition we are probably not getting!

### Techniques

It can be hard to talk about your achievements so these are some tips to help you realise how great you are!

__Create a Personal brand__

Be clear about it, have the confidence to flaunt it and show your true authentic self - it's totally fine to be different too!

__Develop an Experience Map__

What is your goal? Do you want to become a senior developer? Consider the steps required
to get there and draw out what you must do. This will make it easier to figure out what is important for your career and what isn't.

__Start a brag document__

It's easy for you and your manager to forget what you have done in the year! You should include goals for the year, code & non-code contributions, 
collaboration, mentoring, helping the company, what you have learned, participation outside of your job. Don't forget _invisible work_ such as
improving code quality or improving processes.

__Help Others__

Do you struggle to see your own achievements? It's much easier to ask others for help. Start a brag document workshop where you get together with
colleagues or friends every few months to update your documents and get feedback to see examples you don't realise are valuable!

__Network__

_*queue shudder from introverts*_ What is the point of developing a personal brand if no one knows who you are? It's important to expand your network, but this
doesn't mean you have to connect with every single person at an event. 

Networking Hacks
* Have a blog / microblog (eg. Twitter) 
* Become a connector - get a lunch/coffee with someone you dont always work with (different func, different team etc)
* Speak at an event!
* Organise a comparatively low effort event
* Talk to n people before leaving - determine what `n` should be and speak to at least that many people! If you're nervous, just start with 1 then increase
it when you feel ready.

## Levelling up: Developing developers

Melinda provides a great comparison between the way video games are created to the way FutureLearn onboards and develops their team of engineers.
It made a lot of sense - video games guide new players to the game with instructions and examples that are clear with feedback signals.

### New starters

Provide new starters with guides and instructions to help them get settled in, but at the same time don't overload them with information. Think about the game
Tekkan, each player will have various fighting combos but a new player isn't expected to all of know them. 
Instead they will start with the basics such as kicking and dodging. Also, ensure to support and guide them and this can be achieved with giving them a mentor
on their team to check in with them.

### Learning new skills

New starters must be given feedback on a frequent basis to check they understand things and learn from their mistakes. Additionally, it's important for
employees to continue developing their skills and this can be achieved through a variety of activities including learning days, show and tell, book club, 
recommended talks, etc.

Melinda recommends two books to read in regards to Feedback - Difficult Conversations and Thanks for the Feedback

### Levelling Up

When a character in a game levels up the game will include animations to acknowledge that. People need to be acknowledged when they are growing to show they're 
making progress. Also, it's important to share with your team the core competencies and how they're useful in each role. 
Furthermore, don't let job labels become barriers to topics that people want to learn. For example a front-end developer was keen to learn some back-end, but
as it was not part of the front-end role's competencies the person felt restricted. Finally, it hepls to visualise what progression looks like and how they're 
applicable to roles - especially senior ones.  

### Summary

1. Don't overload new starters
2. Support & Guide new starters
3. Give people direct & timely feedback
4. Provide opportunities to apply new skills
5. Achknowledge people's growth
6. Expose basic competencies and how they're used
7. Allow people to choose their own path
8. Visualise what progression looks like

## 0 to 100 Real Quick - Making your First Days Count

If you're a new starter to a job, you know how real those nerves can be! 
Nathanial shares his experience and learned lessons at his first job being a developer advocate.

> Every successful career is a series of successful assignments and every successful assignment is launched with a successful transition

Three things that make a new place intimidating - what will my reputation be? will things change in regards to my commitments and purpose? 
what will the culture be like? 

If there are three things you do in a new role make sure you __Observe, Understand and Create__

### Observe

When you first start make sure you develop a great working relationship with your manager and don't try to do everything. 
Also, don't always stick to what you know as you will learn new things and concepts. Make sure you broaden your knowledge and learn beyond
the technical part of the business as knowing about how the business operates will help you understand the needs of the organisation.

### Understand

With your observations try to understand the business and culture. Ask a lot of questions, even if they seem stupid (eg. "What does that acronym mean?")
and use available resources such as your manager. 

Avoid behaviours where you frequently play the "I'm still new" card, not being mindful and thinking about 
past jobs, and trying to be a hero (Superhero Syndrome) where you overpromise and underdeliver. Finally, make sure to get to know your team and (occasioanlly)
attend social events. 

### Create

> Your career is a marathon not a spring

When you're more familiar with your team, the business and culture you need take what you've learned and create! Don't worry about making mistakes, 
you will make them, but they are key for your development and learning. Be confident in yourself and your abilities and strive for continuous 
learning and improvement. Finally, ensure you have the work/life balance you need!

## Company Culture, Performance Reviews & You

Ruth gives an interesting talk that aims to demystify what "culture fit" truly means and how to handle performance reviews. 

### Culture
* Free food, laundry, onsite services, etc is compensation _NOT_ culture!
* Things such as being your true self is basic human rights
* Humans hate to lose so business culture tends to be about risk and risk aversion
    * Risk and profit are related -> bigger companies become more averse to risk so there are more processes to reduce risk
* Culture in a business comes at different layers - team, department, organisation and company
* Do a culture 'check-in' - evaluate, crowd source, does what is said match what is done and match your development needs?
* There is no 'wrong place' - optimise for your needs and the business. When what you are good at and what the business needs overlap your career will hypercharge!

### Performance Reviews
* Reviews are a reflection of how much your strengths contribute to the performance of the business. It's situationally specific and about alignment.
    * It does _NOT_ evaluate how good of an engineer you are!
* Ensure you get your manager to help you or find one that will help

## Never stop stopping - real talk about when to walk away

Amy states that she's had 23 jobs in her life, so she must be an expert at knowing when it's time to move jobs.
Her presentation, which was coupled with a beautiful song was useful as we all have times where we contemplate moving jobs. 

### Knowing When to Leave

> Staying isn't easier

* Leaving can make us feel emotional, privilege/security, failure (am I a failure for walking away?)
* "It looks bad on my CV" - something that can hold people into jobs they don't like or isn't helping their careers

> "When things aren't going well we gaslight ourselves"

#### Exercise / Tips

* "When I think about work I think about [answer here] " & "I am most worried about [answer here]" & " I am looking forward to [answer here] "
    * Really consider these points and see what they're telling you!

* Investigate what is making you unhappy, Evaluate if you can take any action to change the things that are making you unhappy, Plan and put together your exit strategy

### What determines job satisfaction?

* Engaging work - variety, sense of completion, autonamy, feedback, sense of contribution
* Work that helps others - task significance - the degree to which your job affects other people's lives
* Work you're good at - believe that you are able to do well in a job associated with higher motivation
* Work with people you like - social support is strongly positively correlated with job satisfaction
* Meets your basic needs - reasonable hours, job security, short commute, and fair pay

### Be careful not to focus on these things
* Income
* Low demands - moderate stress levels are associated with higher job satisfaction\
* Status - a title change won't impact you as much as you think


# Reflection

The conference was great and I've learned a lot - I'm going to make an effort and use the techniques for myself and see what improvements I can make in
my team. To improve my experience at conferences I need to make sure I go through talk topics beforehand so I know what to expect and can be better prepared when
taking notes. Additionally, I need to give myself extra time as new venues can be hard to navigate and I was constantly asking helpers questions.

Lots of Love,
Fumi
