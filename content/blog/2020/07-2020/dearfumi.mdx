# A Reminder

I have always wanted to express my thoughts and beliefs, but my biggest barrier is myself. 
I am my worst critic and therefore I have incredibly harsh thoughts on myself, my abilities and my self worth. This post is a reminder that
it's okay to have things not go as expected. It's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to write things online where in my mind it isn't 'good enough'. 
The only way of getting better is to continously try, learn from my mistakes and improve. The worst thing you can do is continuously compare 
yourself to others as that is a one way ticket to depression. 
Some things will feel awkard, embarassing and slightly painful, but it will be worth it in the long run.

If you can remember these things and try to be brave, even if you don't feel it at all, if you just keep trying it will be fine in the end.
