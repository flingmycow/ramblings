# New Beginnings - A reflection and summary

## Cloudy with a chance of GCP

On the 3rd of August I started my new job with Google as a Customer Engineer with a specialism in _Smart Analytics_. What does this mean? I'll be helping Google's customers realise the value of using Google Cloud by using my technical expertise to offer guidance, ideas for cloud solutions and proof of concepts. I'll suggest architectures and solutions for solving their problems or as a new way of working to improve business operations. My expertise lies in 'Smart Analytics', so I'll go deeper on products like BigQuery, PubSub, Dataflow, Dataproc and other data tools.

A day doesn't go by where I am still shocked at this change and it wouldn't surprise me if I receive an email from People Ops (HR) telling me they made a mistake. It's also a weird time to be starting a new job. I have never quit my job and onboarded for a new one remotely. I have never worked in sales or as a sales engineer at all, so the role is a new challenge. I had initial fears regarding visas when the UKVI offices were shut until June. 

All of this in an uncertain time is, well, uncertain and can bring about a lot of worries. Fortunately for me the onboarding process so far at Google has been great. I received my laptop a week before my start date and I had emails from People Ops with details on orientation and other onboarding sessions to attend. I was assigned buddies who regularly checked in with me and answered all my questions regardless of how random they were. I was added to various chat rooms and introduced to people either in 121 calls or team meetings. Even before I started my recruiter was giving me frequent updates and whenever I had questions she replied promptly. Throughout the recruitment process I felt like they genuinely wanted candidates to succeed - there was no ghosting, no long waits and as much clarity as possible. In contrast I have a few job applications I sent in March and I still haven't heard back about them.

## Culture

The part of Google that really attracted me is their culture. I was fortunate to visit their London office in January and had a glimpse of it, which fuelled my desire to work for them. I could also tell they were serious about DEI; it wasn't just a tick box exercise. [Google conducted research into their organisation and identified the most important factors of high-performing teams](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/). Number one is psychological safety and so far I feel safe working at Google. People ask if I want to participate in things and don't add any pressure on my decision. When I am asked for suggestions or opinions they tell me there's __no expectation__ I respond. There have been times when I suggested things that I thought was dumb, but everyone has been appreciative and kind. These are small things, but they make a big difference. Also, when it comes to growing the organisation they look for people who will "culture add" rather than "culture fit" - they want individuals to bring their true selves.

## Onboarding

Normally when you start a new job you will go to the office, get your equipment and sit with your team. You'll have coffees and conversations with team members to learn more about your colleagues, the organisation, current situation, systems and processes, etc. Since 2020 is a strange year we have to do things differently. I'll reiterate the positive things Google have done to ensure the smoothest onboarding process:

* Throughout the entire recruitment process and leading up to my start date Google kept me informed of essentially everything - equipment, visa process, introduction to the lead of my team, what will happen in the first day and week, etc
* Sending my equipment before I start
* Assigning buddies and backup buddies
* Responding to queries quickly
* Checklists of material I can go through to learn about products, processes, systems, and other good to knows
* Automatically registered to various training classes that may be of interest for my learning and development
* Not having unrealistic expectations and everyone is very supportive - people won't say no to a chat
* A bot that automatically pairs you with a random person to have a coffee chat! â˜•

It makes a big difference to new joiners if you can make onboarding smooth and inclusive, especially in these difficult times. 

## Progress so Far

As mentioned earlier there isn't any pressure to contribute to the organisation as I'm still learning. I'm enjoying my time learning more about Google Cloud as I think there's so much that can be achieved with it. I'm also learning about other topics such as inclusive leadership and valuable insights in the manufacturing industry. I've met some very talented, intelligent yet humble people and I am very fortunate to have them as colleagues. My next hurdle is not letting imposter syndrome get the best of me and do less shadowing and more work.
