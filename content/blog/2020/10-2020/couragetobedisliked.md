# Introduction

## Fate or Luck?

I first noticed this book as it was a free title in Amazon's Prime Subscription and the subject caught my attention. I've always struggled with confidence and the reviews seemed good enough to read it. I didn't know what I was expecting, but at first the communication style seemed strange to me. It's presented as a dialogue between a young teenager and a philospher who loves sharing __Individual Psychology__ originally founded by Alfred Adler. However, it was written in this format to mimic how Socrates and Plato had dialogues with peers to cultivate deeper thinking and understanding of philsophical concepts. Communication style aside I felt like I was going on a journey along with the youth, going from reservations and doubt, to realising what I needed to do to be free and feel happiness. 

## Freudian vs Alderian

> "Adlerian psychology is the psychology of study. Your unhappiness cannot be blamed on your past or your environment. And it isn't that you lack competence. You just lack courage."

All right, those aren't the technical terms, but what is the difference between Freud and Adler's psychologies? Freud covers Etiology, the study of causation. Adler on the other hand follows Teleology, the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its cause. 

### Some Terms

* __Pursuit of Superiority__
* __Inferiority Complex__ - condition of using one's inferiority as an excuse. eg. I am not well educated, so I cannot succeed.
    * this is an example of a __Life Lie__

# Key Messages

## Freedom

> "It's that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles"

If you're worried about being disliked and causing problems with others, you're sacrificing freedom. It's a reward-oriented way of thinking when interacting with others. 

I personally like this spin on being disliked by others. I sometimes get anxiety about it, but realistically there will always be someone who dislikes you and your work, but there will also be others who enjoy you and what you do. Don't focus on those that don't and continue doing the things you love!

## Horizontal not Vertical and definitely not the center

It makes your life easier if you look at all relationships with a horizontal view. What that means is seperating tasks and knowing what requires your involvement, and what is entirely down to the other person. You may want to interfere or influence every aspect of a friend or family member, but this means all the cards are in their hands. For example if you desire recognition, you will do whatever it takes to get that person's recognition - something only they have control of. Additionally, seeking recognition from others isn't healthy - it'll become a goal that controls your life. If you're too focused on recognition then you become self-centered and struggle to have concern for others. 

Another belief in Adlerian psychology is that _all problems are interpersonal relationship problems_ and can be a source of unhappiness. Conversely, the opposite can be true and that they are the source of happiness.

## Encouragement, not Force

This idiom, which is referenced frequently, sums it up nicely - "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink"

If someone isn't following through with their tasks, Adlerian psychology views this situation with the belief that the individual doesn't lack ability, but they don't have the courage to face their tasks. For example if a child doesn't want to study, a parent may force their child to read books and write essays, but that turns the relationship into a vertical one. The parent should encourage the student so that they can muster the courage needed and face their tasks on their own. 

## Three Requirements for Community Feeling 

If you can shift your view from a self-centered one to having concerns for others you will gain a sense of community feeling. By haviug community feeling you'll acheive happness.

### Self-Acceptance

> "If one cannot do something, one is simply accepting 'one's incapable self' as is, and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It is not a way of lying to oneself. Accept what is irreplaceable. Accept 'this me' just as it is. And have the courage to change what one can change

If you can accept you for who you are then you can move forward in life. You cannot change what you're born with, but you can create change with the tools you have - focus on what you have control over.

### Confidence not Trust

In order to develop deep, horizontal relationships with others, one needs to have full confidence in others. It's an unconditional connection with others that isn't based on security or other conditions. Yes, it's possible that other people will do things to 'take advantange', but if you focus solely on trust, you may become only concerned with times you were taken advantage of and nothing else. By developing deep relationships with others we are also changing how we percieve and view others - comrades instead of enemies.

### Community

> "People can only be truly aware of their worth when they are able to feel 'I am of use to someone'

The key point to mention here is that a contribution doesn't have to be visible. It can be as simple as existing. For example I am contributing to my cat, Peach, by existing and being a good cat-mother. I know she's happy and has had a good life so far. Everyone can find an example that shows they're contributing to a community - they just need to remember it. You don't need to raise $10000 for charity or find a cure to Coronavirus to have worth. 

## Other Good Points

* We are living in a subjective world - a world that is defined by our viewpoint. It is not objective, so you can change by modifying your perspective on things
* "THe greatest life-lie is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and future, cast a dim light on one's entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something"
* When you're focused on reaching a specific destination, you are living a __Kinetic Life__ rather than a __Energeil Life__, which is an actual-active state life
* "The reason that many people don't really feel happy while they're building up their success in the eyes of society is that they are living in competition"
* "Human beings are all equal, but not the same"
* "Life has no meaning whatsoever, but you can assign meaning to that life. And you are the only one who can assign meaning to your life"

# Final Words

As the book title says we all need courage, especially to be our true selves and be disliked. If people dislike you, then it means you're living life in freedom. Have the courage to believe in yourself and that change _is_ possible. It offers interesting examples and principles to guide people to reframe how they see the world and not be dragged down by bad, past experiences. By changing their subjective view people can move forward and live a truly happy, free, life. 

The book also recognises that understanding humans and ourselves is challenging and can take half of our age to fully change - don't expect any immediate transformations! :)
