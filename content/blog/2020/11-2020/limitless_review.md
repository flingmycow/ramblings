description: A summary and key takeaways from the book Limitless by Jim Kwik

# Introduction
## General Thoughts

> "Give a person an idea, and you enrich their day. Teach a person how to learn, and they can enrich their life"

I really liked this book as Jim provides great models and acronyms to help you improve your ability to consume, think and overcome obstacles for pursuing your goals. He is a great example of someone who overcame his fixed mindset, and regardless of where you are in life, it is possible to change and improve your current weaknesses. I initially bought this book to improve my memory, but I found the recommendations for improving my motivation and mindset just as important as the learning methods. 

## The 3 M's

Jim developed a simple model for becoming _limitless_ - Mindset (what), Motivation (why), and Methods (how). Without these things you will struggle to achieve your goals and dreams. Why do you require all three? Well, if you don't believe in yourself you are limiting your capabilities and possibilities. If you don't have the motivation then how will you complete anything? If you don't use smart models you will not be as effective. 

The book covers 5 areas that helps you become limitless - Focus, Study, Memory Enhancement, Speed Reading and Critical Thinking.

## Why should you care? Do you rely too much on tech?

Although these topics may seem simple, in a time where everything is connected, there are negative consequences of having technology. They are:
1. __Digital Deluge__ - too much content and not enough time to consume it all. It's easy to want to consume all the time, but not giving your brain a break and time to be bored leads to poor memory, mental fog and fatigue.
2. __Digital Distraction__ - we all want to stay connected, but does it really make us happier? Also, when you're constantly grabbing your phone it breaks your concentration and makes it harder to focus back on the task you were doing. We need to practice more JOMO.
3. __Digital Dementia__ - by relying on technology to do everything for us, such as Googling every question you have, you are not exercising your ability to recall and thus those who resort to Google, without making a guess first, usually have worse memory.
4. __Digital Deduction__ - another issue with relying on technology to answer all of your questions can confuse people's perceptions of their own knowledge and intelligence. This reliance can lead to overconfidence and poor decision-making. We rely on certain sources of information to do deduction for us and thus we are not exercising our critical thinking muscles.

# Concepts / Background Knowledge

## Brain

The brain can be modified by our actions and environments - this is neuroplasticity. So whenever you learn something new you create a new synaptic connection and when this happens your brain physically changes. The beliefs we have influence the things we remember. If you think a piece of information is valuable to you then you're more likely to remember it. Also, interestingly in your gastrointestinal tract you have a Enteric Nervous System (ENS), which contains 100 million nerve cells. Scientific research has discovered your gut plays a part in your brain function - the 'gut feeling' you have had in the past isn't something to ignore! It interprets events and provides signals to your brain.

## Learning

According to research our ability to concentrate lasts between 10 and 40 minutes. Spend more time and the impact of our work begins to reduce. This is why techniques such as the Pomodero is recommended. Also, people are more likely to remember the beginning (__Primacy__) and the end (__Recency__) of the content they're consuming. This is why it's a good idea to split your work into chunks - due to primacy and recency reading a book for 2 hours straight is less effective than reading in four 25 minute chunks.

Additionally, learning is affected by your emotions and physical state. Look after yourself by exercising, eating heathly and putting yourself in a state (eg. curiosity, fascination, joy) that is optimal for learning.

### Tips for Better Learning

* Learn with the intent of teaching others
* Learn with a beginniner's mind
* Forget about your limitations
* Engage as much as you can as it helps you truly learn the material (eg. Write code instead of reading about code)
* Frequently review and reflect what you have learned
* Schedule everything you intend on doing - especially personal development and reflection

## Retaining Info

> "He who asks questions cannot avoid the answers"

Have you ever only realised the importance or existance of something after paying more attention to that topic? Answers and information are all around us, but we pay most attention when we ask specific questions related to these concepts. It's important to focus on questions that will help you. Questions such as "What will they think of me?" or "How can I blend in?" will direct all your focus on yourself and other's actions. This is not helpful, limits your attention and can affect your comprehension skills.

Jim's suggested questions for reading or learning something new

1. How can I use this?
2. Why must I use this?
3. When will I use this?

# Mindset

> "All behaviour is driven by self, so before we address how to learn, we must first address the underlying beliefs we hold about what is possible"

## You are not permanent

The things we learn is shaped by our environment, culture and experience. We may learn things such as __Learned Helplessness__, which means you believe your situation cannot be changed so you don't try to fix it. However, anything we learn can also be unlearned and vice versa. Do not believe your own lies and bullshit - take responsibility for your change and believe that you can develop the skills you desire. 

## Let go of the assumptions

One step towards a limitless mindset is to unlearn false assumptions. Jim provides the example of Roger Bannister, a man who ran a mile under 4 minutes. Previously it was believed by (basically) __everyone__ that this was not possible. Once he beat that record another person beat his record, and again it was defeated by someone else. The moral of the story? If you believe these assumptions, you are preventing yourself from trying. Don't let other people or your inner critic stop you from what you truly want to do. 

## Types of Genius

If we're asked to think of a genius, most of us will imagine someone who has a high IQ. However, there are other forms of intelligence that we generally appreciate less. 

Generally speaking there are 4 types:

1. __Dynamo Genius__ - someone who expresses their genius through creativity and ideas. eg. Shakespeare
2. __Blaze Genius__ - a genius that can communicate and connect with others to another level. eg. Oprah, Malala Yousafzai
3. __Tempo Genius__ - someone that can express themselves with their big picture view and not be swayed by other factors. eg. Nelson Mandela
4. __Steel Genius__ - a person that has great attention to detail and knows what to do with a lot of data. eg. Sergey Brin (Google Co-Founder)

The main takeaway here is that being a genius isn't just about being academically smart - there are other skills that are just as relevant.

## Changing your mindset

Jim's Analogy - thermometer vs thermastat

* A thermometer simply tells you the temperature
* A thermastat has the ability to change settings based on environmental factors

A limiting belief is like a thermometer, a limitless mind is like a thermastat.

### Steps

1. __Name your limiting belief__ - be aware and notice the thoughts you're telling yourself. Remember these are __opinions not facts__. Are you using words like 'I'm not' or 'I can't'? Change them from fixed statements to phrases of learning and development.
2. __Get to the facts__ - what is the evidence supporting your limiting belief? Are you _really_ that bad at presenting? Is your inner critic distracting you from your task so you perform worse than usual? This is why it's important to change your mindset.
3. __Create a new belief__ - repurpose your inner critic as a different persona that you can ignore. You don't want to see your inner critic as you, but as a seperate character that you will eventually learn to discredit and ignore :)
4. __Find positivity in your life__ - believe it or not positive emotions helps broaden attention and thinking, reduces lingering of negative thoughts, improve resilience, and greater well-being.

## 7 Lies of Learning

### 1. Intelligence is fixed

* "it's not how smart you are, it's how you are smart"

### 2. We only use 10% of our brains

* "the brain takes up 2% of space by weight, and yet accounts for 20% of energy consumption"
* "after extensively mapping the brain over decades, they've concluded that there are no functionless areas of the brain"
  
### 3. Mistakes are failures

> "You make mistakes, mistakes don't make you"

Albert Einstein made many mistakes throughout his career and he didn't let them stop him. "No one remembers him for his mistakes - we only remember him for his contributions"

We dislike mistakes as we were judged on them as children. Try to see mistakes as proof you are trying rather than evidence of being a failure. When you learn from your mistakes, you will become a better person than before. Never compare yourself to others - only yourself. 

### 4. Knowledge is Power

Knowledge on it's own doesn't achieve anything. Performing some action as a result of learning something new makes knowledge powerful. You can read a book, but if you don't do anything it suggests then you are still at the same stage you were before reading it.

`Knowledge * Action = Power!`

### 5. Learning new things is very difficult

Learning will at the very least be a bit uncomfortable as you would simply be reinforcing things you already know. What's important is that you use good methods and approach learning in logical steps.

### 6. The criticism of other people matters

> "It's not your job to like, love, or respect me. It's mine"

When the Wright brother's first made a machine that could fly, everyone was so skeptical of the prospect of a machine being able to fly that they either didn't believe it or ridiculed it. This did not stop the Wright brothers and they continued working on their flying machine. If they had stopped pursuing their dream as a result of everyone's criticism things would be different today. 

Don't let criticism stop you from pursuing your dreams - let regret scare you even more into doing what you truly want to do. Also, don't take criticism from anyone you wouldn't take advice from. There will always be someone who doubts you or dislikes you work. 

> "The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is"

### 7. Genius is born

Jim describes Bruce Lee's life journey to becoming the legend he is today. He didn't have his martial arts skills from the start - a series of events and experiences helped him develop these skills throughout his life. He faced many problems, but he powered through and this choice to face his challenges meant he kept growing and growing. When someone possesses a skill that seems like magic, we are only seeing the final product and there is a lot of deliberate practice and methods to get to that stage. 

## Key Takeaways
* You can prevent yourself from achieving your goals and at the same time you can push yourself to grow
* You __can__ be better at `[some skill here]` regardless of what people have told you before
* A lot of common beliefs amongst people are just wrong. Rewire your inner critic and beliefs and you can go on to to do great things!
* Mistakes are inevitable, but they also mean you are trying and will help you be a better you

# Motivation

`Movation = Purpose * Energy * S3`

<sub>S3 = small, simple step</sub>

## Purpose

Passion is what makes you excited inside, and purpose is how you relate to other people using your passions. When you use statements that start with "I am", it influences your future. For example saying "I am an alcoholic" will make it hard for you to quit alcohol. Not convinced? [There was a study where people who used identifying statements (eg "being a voter") were more likely to vote than people who were simply asked about their likelihood of voting.](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/31/12653)

If you're struggling to movtivate yourself to do a task, then you need to create a more compelling reason to do it. I don't workout because I enjoy it, I work out because I want to be healthy. You shouldn't wait for a perfect environment to do something - instead remind yourself of the benefits of doing something, or conversely, the negative consequences of not doing a task. Align these with your personal values and goals to make it easier.

## Energy

Tips for maximising your brain's capacity
1. __Good Brain Diet__ - Avocados, Blueberries, Broccoli, Dark chocolate, Eggs, Green leafy vegetables, Salmon/sardines/caviar, tumeric, walnuts
2. __Brain Nutrients__ - Get supplements if you're unable to consume any of the above ingredients. Suggested nutrients include phospholipid DHA, B vitamins, Curcumin.
3. __Exercise__ - "exercise changes the brain in ways that protect memory and thinking skills"
4. __Killing Ants__ - Remove automatic negative thoughts that places limitations on you. These are preventing you from fulfilling your true potential.
5. __Be in a Clean Environment__
6. __Surround Yourself by Positive Peers__ - "who you spend time with is who you become"
7. __Protect Your Brain!__
8. __Keep Learning__ - if you keep learning you're exercising your brain, thus keeping it capable of learning new information
9. __Stress Management__ - stress creates cortisol, the more you create the more risk you are at negatively affecting your brain's capabilities
10. __Sleep is NOT a Choice - Don't Skip it!__ - if you're struggling to fall asleep try meditating or just pay attention to your breathing.

## Small, Simple Steps

> "Only three things change a person's behaviour long term. One is to have an epiphany. Another is to change your environment. The third is to take baby steps"

__Zeigamik effect__: uncompleted tasks create a level of tension that keeps the task at the front of our minds until it is completed

People usually procrastinate because they're avoiding a big project or task as it seems very difficult. This can lead to unhelpful thought patterns that triggers sleep issues, anxiety symptoms and other mental health problems. How to approach your work? First, be kind to yourself. Don't feel ashamed for not completing some work - progress isn't linear! Secondly, split the task into smaller, easier to complete tasks. Then start with the first step - your mind will feel better once you start working on the task. If you keep following this process then one day it'll become a habit. According to studies it takes an average of sixty-six days to create a habit. Focus on creating small, good habits as they will reward you in the long-term. At the beginning you won't see the impact of meditating ten minutes or eating a chocolate bar every day, but in a year you will see a big difference.

## Fogg Behaviour Model

1. __Motivation__ - pleasure/pain, hope/fear (eg. setting 10 alarms to not miss a test), social acceptance/rejection
2. __Ability__ - factors influencing whether we can complete a task -> Time, Money (not too expensive), Physical Effect (can we physically do it?), Brain cycles (can't be too hard), Social Deviance (is this normal in society?), Nonroutine (is this close enough to our usual routine?)
3. __Prompts__ - spark (eg. email otification), facilitator (eg. software that helps you do taxes; motivation high, ability low), signal (eg. placing fruit near your desk as a reminder)

### Tips for creating a new habit
* Ensure it's something you actually want
* Is it something that you can actually achieve some day? If it's too hard simplify and make an easier habit (eg. Don't make a habit to run 3km a day when you don't even go out. Make it a smaller goal)
* Create prompts or reminders for doing the habit - best to set a specific time to do it.
