# December Reflection

> ‘It is not sufficient to have an experience in order to learn. Without reflecting on this experience it may quickly be forgotten, or its learning potential lost.’

## Reflecting on Reflections

I'm still learning about reflecting on my recent experiences and coming up with reasonable evaluations. 
I used to give in to my perfectionist inner critic and allowed the overly negative and critical voice to control me to the point where I believed I was a broken human being. 
I always focused on the negative and was never truly happy when things didn't go exactly how I expected.

I'm trying to be kinder and realistic with myself. Reading many self-help books and realising I cannot change by merely reading - I must do. 
By blogging about these experiences, I hope to reduce unhelpful negativity and focus on learning points. 
Furthermore, it will allow me to track how I progress and show little, incremental growth steps.

## Brief Background
A little background on me to give context before diving into the reflection, I am timid and have social anxiety. 
I always found it intimidating to engage with people, especially in groups. 
My worries usually centre around judgement and how people will perceive my actions and words. 
My way of escaping some of these challenging situations was to hide behind a computer. Becoming friends with my computer meant I could engage in alternate worlds and temporarily escape reality; 
it also leads me to pursue a career in technology. The downside is that I never truly tackled the primary problem by avoiding my fears, and as a result, I still struggle in certain social situations. 
I don't want this to control my life anymore, and one technique to help manage my mind is blogging and reflecting.

## The Reflections

### Things That Went Well

* Engaged with a couple of customers for the first time - they appeared to be appreciative of the work
* Passed my Data Engineering exam
* Compared to what I knew when I first started, I am getting a feel to required responsibilities on the role and the different processes/systems involved

### Things that didn't go so well

* Thirsty for work and involvement to the point where I overcommitted
* Not networking (fast) enough
* Managing my priorities and tasks 
* Navigating an overwhelming amount of information
* Asking for the right help
* Being so nervous that I come across unenthusiastic

### Enjoy Being New and Time is Limited 
When starting a new job, especially remotely, it's easy to feel an overpowering eagerness to work on projects and help the team deliver.  
However, it's important to remember that you only start a job once (each time). You won't get a quiet period like that again, so make the most of it to network with the team and learn the processes and systems. Time is a scarce resource. 
Also, beware of overcommitting. If you're in a new and different role, it may not be clear how long tasks will take, so it's easy to say 'yes' to everything then realise you don't have enough time to do everything.  I misjudged my time available as I had many training and meetings to attend, with little time for actual work. Going forward I need to be confident with saying 'no' :)

### Networking Remotely

I have never started a job remotely and meeting others is much more comfortable in person. You could easily follow a group and see who else they speak to, and conversations start and flow naturally. I started the new job excited, but also nervous. I knew my colleagues are great individuals, with a lot of work. I think my perception of self-worth held me back from immediately booking introductions with the team. I thought that I would be 'interrupting' people and being a disruption, but that's far from reality. My colleagues were all amiable, and even when I didn't know what to say, it was pleasant to get to know them better. My mind tends to imagine the worst-case scenario, and it never turned out like that. I still have people I need to speak with from other teams, so more chats to book in 2021!

#### Tips for shy or socially anxious people like me

* Don't know who to speak to? Ask someone on your team like your manager.
* Worried about topics? Ask them what their work history is like, what they're currently working on, their interests, what they like about the job, if there is anything you can shadow or read to understand the role more
* Don't worry if there is 'awkward silence' - it happens all the time.

### Asking for Help
I've always hated asking for help. I would rather spend more time trying to solve a problem or find an answer to a question. 
Sometimes I worry that I should know how to do specific tasks, but that dreaded word controls my behaviour. I avoid asking for help in fear that I will get fired. 
However, if a colleague said the same thing to me, I would think that's absurd. 
Everyone asks for help at some point - so why is this different for me? In the future, if I spend 5 to 10 minutes on something and I am still stuck, it's best to ask someone for help. 
There is nothing wrong with that, and it's a smarter move - I'll waste less time.

### Nervous -> Resting Bitch Face
Engaging in calls with customers or a group of people is hard. A flurry of anxious thoughts fills my mind and can be hard to focus on the main task - communicating, explaining, or merely chatting. As a result, I come across unenthusiastic and combined with my resting bitch face people probably think I hate them, which is entirely far from the truth. To be more comfortable and practice with meetings, particularly virtual ones, I have signed up to Toastmasters and other training for better engagement over virtual calls.

## Roundup
I'm in a new role that will challenge me in so many ways. 
I just need to push through, face my fears and go through the uncomfortable experiences to truly grow. Perhaps one day, I'll live where my social anxiety doesn't control me anymore.
